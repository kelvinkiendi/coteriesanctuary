**Stack:** PostgreSQL · Supabase · React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS

## 🏗 Backend Architecture

### Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Supabase)
- **9 normalized tables** with foreign key relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Automated triggers for perks expiry and engagement scoring

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `clients` | Member profiles with client type (regular/founder), contact info, status |
| `founder_circle` | Enrollment tracking, payment status, term dates, founder number (1-25) |
| `appointments` | Specialized booking types: weekly refresh, gel rescue, travel touchup, birthday sanctuary, emergency |
| `perks_usage` | Perk redemption tracking with week/month allocation and expiry |
| `surprise_moments_log` | Documented surprise rewards and random upgrades |
| `products` | Product catalog with founder pricing (cost + 20%), prelaunch access |
| `founder_purchases` | Purchase history with prelaunch window tracking |
| `founder_brunch_events` | Exclusive event management |
| `brunch_attendance` | RSVP tracking with dietary notes and photo consent |

### Business Logic
- **Founder limit enforcement:** Hard cap of 25 active founders
- **Perk allocation:** Weekly refreshes, travel touchups, surprise moments auto-assigned
- **Engagement scoring:** Automated scoring based on appointment frequency and purchases
- **Referral tracking:** Referral count linked to founder rewards
